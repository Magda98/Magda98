## Biography
I graduated from the University of Technology in Rzeszow with a Master of Engineering in Computer Science. During my studies, I was an active member of the Student Science Club KOD and the Student Government. I developed and maintained a new version of the Science Club's website using the **Vue framework** and also created a new version of the Student Government's website. Additionally, I worked on several other projects using **Vue** throughout my academic career.

Currently I work as an **Angular Developer**, continuously honing my frontend skills through courses, staying updated with the latest news, reading articles, and creating personal projects. My passion for Angular led me to attend the recent NgPoland conference. Additionally, I keep abreast of Angular developments by following news, RFCs on GitHub, and other relevant updates.

I am also deeply passionate about artificial intelligence, particularly in the realms of **machine learning and deep learning**. For my master's thesis and a recent hackathon, I developed **convolutional neural network** (CNN) models using **PyTorch**. I stay current in this ever-evolving field by regularly reading news and articles about AI.
