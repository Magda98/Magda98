## Biography
I graduated from the University of Technology in Rzeszow with Master of Engineering in computer science. I was active in the Student Science Club KOD and Student Government. I am eager to learn new technologies. I try to constantly develop frontend skills by doing courses, following the news and reading articles. I am also interested in machine learning/deep learning. I like long walks, I am also passionate about winter sports - I love skiing.
